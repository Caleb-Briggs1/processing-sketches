That man you let die was Dante. The man fated to bring humanity back on the path of truth*But now you have let die all that was hope, all that was future. *Your purpose is now gone, and with that, you.
While you were over there, waiting around in your safe place, the man calling out to you was consumed by the beasts.* He was Dante, the pilgrim fated to bring humanity back on the path of truth* With his death, you die too.
